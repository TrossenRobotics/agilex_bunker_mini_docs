dust, and water. Benefiting from a compact size, a strong off road climbing ability, and a zero
radius turn, tt offers industry developers a better platform to deploy robotic applications such as
waterway surveying and mapping, mineral exploration, pipeline inspection, security, autonomous
transportation, and more. Open-source packages are available for C++ and ROS for secondary
development.
